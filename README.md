HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, FIREBASE

RPS-Multiplayer is essentially a rock, paper, scissors game application that is to be programmed to be multiplayer and have the ability for players to interact by message and play from two separate browser locations. This is to utilize firebase database to handle the multiplayer data. The rules of the game are simple;

1. Rock beats Scissors, 
2. Paper beats rock, 
3. Scissors beats paper,

The first player will click the image of the rock, paper, or scissors to make their move. Player 2 must make their choice without knowing what player 1 has chosen. The possibbility of a tie exists as well if each player chooses the same object.

This app is partial as some fine tuning in javascript is still needed as well as a chat console that is connected to the database.
